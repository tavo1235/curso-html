            <h2>The Core Concept</h2>
            <p>Each player is dealt <b>two private cards</b> (hole cards). Five <b>community cards</b> are then dealt face-up in the middle of the table. Your goal is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards.</p>

                <h2>Pro Tips for Beginners</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Don't play every hand: Most pros fold about 70-80% of their starting hands. If your two cards aren't strong (like a high
                    pair or big cards like Ace-King), it’s often better to fold early.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Position is power: Being the last person to act in a betting round is a huge advantage because you get to see what
                    everyone else did before you make your move.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Watch the "Blinds": Before cards are dealt, the two players to the left of the dealer must put in forced bets (Small
                    Blind and Big Blind) to ensure there is always money to play for.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The Showdown: If two or more players remain after the final betting round, they show their cards. The best hand wins the
                    entire pot. If everyone folds but one player, that player wins without having to show their cards!</li>
                </ul>
            <blockquote>"In golf, no one learns to hit a draw, a fade, or a cut shot until they've been taught how to hit the ball straight.
            Similarly, novice poker players need to learn how to 'hit it straight' before taking on more difficult concepts."-
